# Data Analysis Homework Assignments

## Introduction
This repository showcases my work on data analysis tasks as part of my learning journey in Python and Pandas. Each task focuses on different data analysis techniques ranging from basic to advanced levels.

## Homework Breakdown
- **Homework 2.1:** Explores data from a table on Wikipedia about birth rates in Ukraine. Includes data cleaning and bar chart visualization.
- **Homework 2.2:** Analyzes a CSV file from a developer survey conducted in 2017. The task includes data cleaning, aggregation, and saving results in a new CSV file.
- **Homework 2.3:** Uses a dataset from Kaggle about the Top 50 best-selling books on Amazon. Focuses on more advanced Pandas features, data aggregation, and visualization.

## Visualization
Each notebook includes 3 to 5 different types of graphs, such as bar charts, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and line plots. These visualizations are designed to provide diverse insights into the datasets.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## How to Use
Each Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) in the repository corresponds to a part of the homework. You can view these notebooks to see the analysis process, code, and visualizations for each dataset.

Feel free to explore these notebooks and use them as a reference for your own data analysis projects.
